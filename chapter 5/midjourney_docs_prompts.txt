A PROMPT IS A SHORT TEXT PHRASE THAT THE MIDJOURNEY BOT INTERPRETS TO
PRODUCE AN IMAGE. THE MIDJOURNEY BOT BREAKS DOWN THE WORDS AND PHRASES
IN A PROMPT INTO SMALLER PIECES, CALLED TOKENS, THAT CAN BE COMPARED
TO ITS TRAINING DATA AND THEN USED TO GENERATE AN IMAGE. A
WELL-CRAFTED PROMPT CAN HELP MAKE UNIQUE AND EXCITING IMAGES.
STRUCTURE
BASIC PROMPTS
A basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji

ADVANCED PROMPTS
More advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple
text phrases, and one or more parameters

Image Prompts
Image URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content
of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.

Prompt Text
The text description of what image you want to generate. See below for
prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate
amazing images.
Parameters
Parameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect
ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of
the prompt.

PROMPTING NOTES
PROMPT LENGTH
Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will
produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on
Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better
for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better.
Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.
GRAMMAR
The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or
words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms
work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic,
enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean
each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and
hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot
will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider
capitalization.
Midjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at
interpreting traditional sentence structure.
FOCUS ON WHAT YOU WANT
It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t
want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will
probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the
final image, try advance prompting using the  no parameter.
THINK ABOUT WHAT DETAILS MATTER
Anything left unsaid may suprise you. Be as specific or vague as you
want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a
great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you
want.
TRY TO BE CLEAR ABOUT ANY CONTEXT OR DETAILS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO
YOU. THINK ABOUT:
      SUBJECT: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.
      MEDIUM: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry,
etc.
      ENVIRONMENT: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater,
the Emerald City, etc.
      LIGHTING: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc
      COLOR: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and
white, pastel, etc.
      MOOD: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.
      COMPOSITION: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.
USE COLLECTIVE NOUNS
Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats"
is more specific than "cats." Collective nouns also work, “flock of
birds” instead of "birds.”
