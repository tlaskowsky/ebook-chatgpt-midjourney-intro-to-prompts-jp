MULTI PROMPTS

IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE MIDJOURNEY BOT CONSIDER TWO OR MORE
SEPARATE CONCEPTS INDIVIDUALLY USING :: AS A SEPARATOR. SEPARATING
PROMPTS ALLOWS YOU TO ASSIGN RELATIVE IMPORTANCE TO PARTS OF A PROMPT.
MULTI-PROMPT BASICS
Adding a double colon :: to a prompt indicates to the Midjourney Bot
that it should consider each part of the prompt separately. In the
example below, for the prompt hot dog all words are considered
together, and the Midjourney Bot produces images of tasty hotdogs. If
the prompt is separated into two parts, hot:: dog both concepts are
considered separately, creating a picture of a dog that is warm.
There is no space between the double colons ::
Multi-prompts work with Model Versions 1, 2, 3, 4, '5, niji, and niji
5
Any parameters are still added to the very end of the prompt.
HOT DOG
  Image of the Midjourney Prompt hotdog 
_Hot dog_ is considered as a single thought.
HOT:: DOG
  Image of the Midjourney Prompt hot:: dog 
_Hot_ and _dog_ Hot and dog are considered separate thoughts
cup cake illustration
 Image of the Midjourney Prompt cup:: cake illustration 
_Cup cake illustration_ is considered together producing illustrated
images of cup cakes.
cup:: cake illustration
 Image of the Midjourney Prompt cup:: cake illustration:: 
_Cup_ is considered separately from _cake illustration_ producing
images of cakes in cups.
cup:: cake:: illustration
 Image of the Midjourney Prompt cup:: cake:: illustration:: 
_Cup_, _cake_, and _illustration_ are considered separately, producing
a cake in a cup with common illustration elements like flowers and
butterflies.
PROMPT WEIGHTS
When a double colon :: is used to separate a prompt into different
parts, you can add a number immediately after the double colon to
assign the relative importance to that part of the prompt.
In the example below, the prompt hot:: dog produced a dog that is hot.
Changing the prompt to hot::2 dog makes the word HOT twice as
important as the word dog, producing an image of a dog that is _very
hot!_
 Model Versions  1, 2, 3 only accept whole numbers as weights
 Model Versions  4 can accept decimal places for weights
Non-specified weights default to 1.
HOT:: DOG
  Image of the Midjourney Prompt hot:: dog 
_Hot_ and _dog_ are considered as separate thoughts
HOT::2 DOG
  Image of the Midjourney Prompt hot::2 dog 
_Hot_ is twice as important as _Dog_
WEIGHTS ARE NORMALIZED:
hot:: dog is the same as hot::1 dog, hot:: dog::1,hot::2 dog::2,
hot::100 dog::100, etc.
cup::2 cake is the same as cup::4 cake::2, cup::100 cake::50 etc.
cup:: cake:: illustration is the same as cup::1 cake::1
illustration::1, cup::1 cake:: illustration::, cup::2 cake::2
illustration::2 etc.
NEGATIVE PROMPT WEIGHTS
Negative weights can be added to prompts to remove unwanted elements.
The sum of all weights must be a positive number.
vibrant tulip fields
 Image of the Midjourney Prompt vibrant tulip fields 
A range of colored tulips are produced.
vibrant tulip fields:: red::-.5
 Image showing the results of negative weights when multi prompting in
Midjourney 
_Tulip fields are less likely to contain the color red._
WEIGHTS ARE NORMALIZED SO:
tulips:: red::-.5 is the same as tulips::2 red::-1, tulips::200
red::-100, etc.
THE  NO PARAMETER
The  no parameter is the same as weighing part of a multi prompt to
"-.5" vibrant tulip fields:: red::-.5 is the same as vibrant tulip
fields  no red.
